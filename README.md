# LearnAndShare
A website repository on GitHub for teaching, lessons and exercises (of what I know).
<br>
*Every place where there is a `has` or any present verb that doesn't make sense, just see it as a `will` because this project isn't even started.*
<br>
*You may know some of the things that I wrote here, that's because I'm writing for people that don't know.*
<br>
It has a **lessons part**, and an **exercises** part.
<br>
## Lessons part
The Lessons part has a title, some text and a link (or button) for exercises.
<br>
## Exercises part
The Exercises part has buttons, input textfields and a check button.
