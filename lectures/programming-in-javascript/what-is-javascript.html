		A programming language is <b>a text written that a computer can read and convert it to bits</b> <i>(0/1)</i> <b>that it understands. Bits are the computer's language.</b>
		<br>
		Unfortunately, <b>people don't understand bits</b>, but <b>they can understand code</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are <b>many programming languages</b> that exist. And every programming language has <b>its own syntax</b>.
		<br>
		Some languages have <b>simmilar syntax</b>.
		<br>
		<i>For example, C++, Javascript and Java have simmilar syntax.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		We can divide programming languages into two main groups:
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Object-oriented programming languages</b>
				<br>
				It is called like that because it has objects and objects are used for having some data and properties organized inside data holders - objects.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Not object-oriented programming languages</b>
				<br>
				These programming languages only have writing lines of code after lines of code... and then executing.
			</li>
		</ol>
		I personally prefer object-oriented programming.
		<br>
		But that doesn't mean that you need to prefer it, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, Javascript <b>is</b> an object-oriented programming language, because it has all those objects about changing elements on our website and computing stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
		Javascript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.

	</p>
	<p>
		Javascript was first called <b>Livescript</b>, but because it had very simmilar syntax with Java (like classes, declaring objects, try/catch, etc...), <b>it was renamed to Javascript</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Except...</i>
		<br>
		Javascript is a programming language <b>for a browser/interpreter</b> that can execute it, but it cannot be used to compile and run it on your local computer.
		<br>
		Javascript is for a browser, for interactive apps, for Scratch projects and other.
	</p>
	<p>
		So now, when you know something about Javascript, let's get started!
